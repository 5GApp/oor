Android
--------

Since version 0.3.4, LISPmob integrates support for android devices as LISP
mobile nodes. Functionalities are limited to one IPv4 and one IPv6 EID mapped
to RLOCs of one interface (no multihoming support). If you require NAT
functionality, it is recommended you first read the NAT traversal section of
the README.md file.

Installation
------------

To install LISPmob on your device, you require root access and an Android version 
2.3.6 or higher. You can download a precompiled APK package file from the LISPmob
website or compile it yourself. In both cases the device must be configured to
allow the installation of packages from "unknown sources".

To install LISPmob from source code you require some extra packages apart from the
ones specified in the main README.md file.

  * Android SDK
  * Android NDK
  * Apache Ant

The latest version of the LISPmob source code can be obtained from Github:

    git clone git://github.com/LISPmob/lispmob.git -b android
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

To build the code, enter the `android/` directory located in the top-level
directory and modify the `local.properties` file with the path to your Android
SDK and Android NDK.  In the Android SDK Manager you should either have
Android 4.2.2 (API 17) installed, or update the `project.properties` file to
specify the target API you have installed. Please note that regardless of the
target API you have installed, LISPmob should still work on all Android
releases from API 9 (Android 2.3 Gingerbread) and above.

Compile the code:

    ant debug

This command generates an APK file called `lispmob-debug.apk` in the folder
`android/bin/`. To install it, copy the file to the device and install it using
the android application manager, or run:

    adb install [-r] bin/lispmob-debug.apk

Building the code from source is supported on Linux and Mac OS X.

Running LISPmob
---------------

LISPmob Android application allows you to start and stop lispd daemon and edit the 
most important parameters of the configuration file. To access to the full list of 
features you have to edit manually the configuration file located in 
/sdcard/lispd.conf.  Manually edited parameters not present in the configuration 
form will be overwritten when using the application configuration editor. 

Due to the large amount of data generated by the lispd daemon, it is recommended 
to set "log level" to 0 when not debugging.
