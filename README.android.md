Android
--------

Since version 0.3.4, LISPmob integrates support for android devices as LISP 
mobile nodes.
Functionalities are limited to one IPv4 and one IPv6 EID mapped to RLOCs of one 
interface (no multihoming support). If you require NAT functionality, it is 
recommended you first read the NAT traversal section of the README file.

Installation
------------

To install LISPmob on your device, you require root access and an Android version 
2.3.6 or higher. You can download a precompiled  APK packet from LISPmob website 
or compile it yourself. In both cases the device must be configured to allow the 
installation of packages from "unknown sources".

To install LISPmob from source code you require some extra packets apart from the 
ones specified in the main README file.

  * 'Android SDK'
  * 'Android NDK'
  * 'Apache Ant'


The latest version of the LISPmob source code can be obtained from Github:

	git clone git://github.com/LISPmob/lispmob.git -b android
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

To build the code, enter the android directory located in the top-level directory 
and modify the "local.properties" file with the path of your Android SDK and 
Android NDK.

Compile the code:

	ant debug

This command generates an APK file called lispmob-debug.apk in the folder 
android/bin/. To install it, copy the file to the device and install it using the 
android application manager.

Running LISPmob
---------------

LISPmob Android application allows you to start and stop lispd daemon and edit the 
most important parameters of the configuration file. To access to the full list of 
features you have to edit manually the configuration file located in 
/sdcard/lispd.conf.  Manually edited parameters not present in the configuration 
form will be overwritten when using the application configuration editor. 

Due to the large amount of data generated by the lispd daemon, it is recommended 
to set "log level" to 0 when not debugging.
