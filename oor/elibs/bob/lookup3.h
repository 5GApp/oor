These are functions for producing 32-bit hashes for hash table lookup.
hashword(), hashlittle(), hashlittle2(), hashbig(), mix(), and final()
are externally useful functions.  Routines to test the hash are included
if SELF_TEST is defined.  You can use this free for any purpose.  It's in
the public domain.  It has no warranty.

You probably want to use hashlittle().  hashlittle() and hashbig()
hash byte arrays.  hashlittle() is is faster than hashbig() on
little-endian machines.  Intel and AMD are little-endian machines.
On second thought, you probably want hashlittle2(), which is identical to
hashlittle() except it returns two 32-bit hashes for the price of one.
You could implement hashbig2() if you wanted but I haven't bothered here.*/
