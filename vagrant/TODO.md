# TODO

* Create a definition for an OpenDaylight based map server VM, which is not
  created even in the default configuration with simple `vagrant up` (using
  `autostart: false`)
* Create two xTR VMs with one EID-only VM behind each
* Maybe make it possible to connect the testbed to the LISP Beta Network
* Maybe use the testbed for automated testing
